# State Trotter
## A States Bucket-list App built by JANK (Joe Belmonte, April Feirman, Nikki Riser, and Kelly English-James)

## About State Trotter
State Trotter is a bucket list app divided by state. A user can select a state from the map and add bucket list items for that state.

Third project for the Web Development Immersive at General Assembly.
We built the app over a 5-day sprint. The server may take 15 to 30 seconds to respond when you first create an account. The back end is hosted on Heroku, which puts the API to sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity.

- Back-end: Node, Express, MongoDB,

## Strategy for Planning, Development, & Problem-Solving:
We decided to use the 50 US states to frame our bucket list project.  We know that some
people aspire to visit all 50 United States as a life goal, so we wanted to build an app
that would help to track progress against that goal.  We decided on this framework in
one of our first team meetings.

We spent a couple of hours on the planning phase, which helped quite a bit.  We
reviewed the user stories and wireframes and made sure to cross-reference our plans
with the project prompt to ensure that we would meet requirements.  We used [Trello](https://trello.com/) for tracking tasks and assigning them to individuals.

From there, we split into pairs for programming.  We rotated pairs over the course
of the work but also met frequently as a team, at least once in the morning and evenings
to game plan and also throughout the day, which helped to keep everyone on track.

Programming progressed slowly but steadily. One of our main challenges on the last
day was that we realized the way we had divided our code up between files (events.js
versus ui.js specifically) was flawed and needed to be refactored.  We spent about
2 hours late Wednesday on that.  Ultimately we were successful in revising the code,
but it did cost us some time and aggravation along the way.  In the end, it was a
good lesson to carry forward.

Ultimately, we were not able to complete most of our stretch goals, but instead,
we chose to focus on putting together a working app that satisfied all requirements.
We also learned quite a bit about working collaboratively through GitHub and
resolving merge conflicts when they arose.
